ARIceSheetWeb

This is the source code for the development of AR Ice Sheet, a Unity project that simulates the 3D deformation of an ice sheet based on the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA).
The model is interactive, the user can change the mass balance over part of the ice sheet to add or remove ice - thus raising or lowering the height of the ice sheet surface. This is controlled using the cursor position anf the UI slider.


To test it out, visit the WebGL version of the application here:
